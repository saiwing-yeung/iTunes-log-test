# log-tunes

A Menubar application that records media that you have played on iTunes

The log file is a CSV file with these fields:

* date - In the format of yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
* name - media name
* artist
* album
* tracknum
* genre
* category - Music, iTunes U. This is not a field directly supplied by iTunes. The program determines this simply based on the location of your media file. More specifically, it grabs the directory in the path of the media that follows ~/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music/. For many media this is empty.
* length 
* rating - This value is given by iTunes. The rating here equals the number of stars in iTunes times 20, e.g., rating of 50 = 2.5 stars, rating of 60 = 3 stars, etc.
* count - Play Count

Five of the fields (name, artist, album, genre, and category) are quoted in single quotes. Single quotes that exist inside the fields are escaped with a back-slash.

Default location of the log is ~/Documents/iTunes-log.csv

# Known issues

* If you select an existing file, the new log will be appended to the end of the file.


If you 1) pause and then un-pause, or 2) modify any attribute of the media (e.g., song name, rating, etc.) then iTunes will send us a new Play notification.

We use the following algorithm to prevent from logging these spurious notifications: We check the PersistentID of the media (a unique ID that iTunes gives every media file) and the Play Count. If the PersistentID is different from the previous one then we will log it. If PersistentID is the same then we will log it only if the play count has been incremented.

This is only a heuristic though and is not 100% correct.


# ToDo

* Use play time and media length to determine whether a notification is a result of song attributes getting changed (instead of a real play).
